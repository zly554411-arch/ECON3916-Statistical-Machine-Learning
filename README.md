# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with cutting-edge data science methodologies.

## 👋 About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world economic problems. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]**, where I can apply both rigorous economic thinking and modern computational tools to drive insights and inform decision-making.

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository documents my coursework as I explore the intersection of **causal inference** and **predictive analytics**. The course follows a **"Concept Extension" philosophy**—we start with foundational statistical concepts (like OLS regression) and scale them up using powerful Machine Learning algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods). 

Through hands-on labs and projects, I'm developing skills to:
- Apply economic theory to real-world datasets
- Build predictive models that respect causal relationships
- Interpret complex models in economically meaningful ways
- Translate technical findings into actionable insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The tools and technologies I'm working with include:

- **Python** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) – Core programming language
- **Pandas** ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?style=flat&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) – Data manipulation and analysis
